# Threat Model – Phishing Campaign Detection Platform

## 1. System Overview
This system ingests content from multiple communication channels, including email messages, URLs, and web or API-submitted text, to identify potential phishing and social engineering activity. Incoming events are processed in near real time using a combination of rule-based checks and machine learning inference to assign a risk score and determine whether events are related to a broader attack campaign. The system correlates similar events over time to provide campaign-level visibility and generates security alerts with limited automated response actions. The platform is deployed as a cloud-native service on Microsoft Azure and is intended to support operational decision-making by SOC analysts in small to mid-sized organizations.
## 2. Assets to Protect
The primary assets protected by this system include user credentials that may be targeted by phishing attacks, the integrity of security decisions produced by the detection pipeline, and the detection logic itself, including rule-based heuristics and machine learning models. The system also protects campaign correlation data, which provides insight into coordinated attack activity and is critical for long-term threat analysis.

Secondary assets include ingested event data that may contain sensitive information, automated response mechanisms such as alerts and deny-lists, and overall system availability, including protection against resource exhaustion and cost abuse. Compromise of these assets could degrade system effectiveness or cause operational disruption.
